You are a piling  
standing in deep blue  
swelling swirling  
ocean  

Crisp winter morning  
brings frost  
and a chilling  
nip from the sea  

Hot summer day  
sun glistening  
as children play  
in warm waters  

Windy fall brings  
a churning froth  
White waves whipping  
trying to tip you  

Wind wails  
causing you to sway  
back and forth  
teetering  

Buried in the mud  
the ground supports  
the shifting  
against the storm  

Far from home  
you recollect  
the bygone days  
in that grove  

Here you are  
skin peeled back  
stripped of what  
you once were  

Nowhere to grow  
Your roots stripped  
but you stand strong  
against a churning sea

I haven't written in ages and was still bad back then. Started with an idea but couldn't follow through (too many *ing*). Oh well it is just a free write.
