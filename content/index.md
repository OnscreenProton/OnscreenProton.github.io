# Hi

Hi! I'm OnscreenProton and you can probably find me across the internet as OnscreenProton. I don't really know too much about programming and am not really trying to learn. Hopefully you never have the misfortune of ever running across any of my work.

## Why even write this?

I'm not exactly sure why I even chose to create this page. Writing is something I am not good at, and I am terrible at maintaining old projects (I never post on my blog). I guess I just wanted somewhere to express myself and to see what I can do with my highly limited knowledge of html and css. Pretty much none of the website is actually mine (as of 30 July 2024), but I'm hoping to change that.

## TODO

There are many other things I should do besides what is listed here, but this is just a preliminary list.

- [x] Convert the site to use [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and move my blog over here
- [x] Figure out how to set up a light/dark toggle button without using JavaScript.
  - I couldn't ever figure out how to do this without JavaScript, but am fine with it using JavaScript now.
- [ ] Shrink the site even more! I think I've gotten it down to less than 40kb on each page and 250kb for the site as a whole, but think I can go even further.
- [ ] Improve accessibility features of the site and implement a responsive UI too
- [ ] Add more content (obviously)

## Credits

- Thank you to [teppy](https://teppyslayouts.neocities.org/) for the wonderful layout and css.
- [vanilla-tilt.js](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/) for the (somewhat unescessary) tilting function for my avatar.
- [The example blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) which provides the framework for the new blog part of the site.
- [CSS Pattern](https://css-pattern.com/) for the silly background so my site is not so boring.
- The [32bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe) for providing a list to help me think about what to write.
