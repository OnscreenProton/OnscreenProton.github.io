			"content_html": "<h2>Update</h2>\n<p>I think I finally got this site working with eleventy and gh-pages! It was mostly not my work since I took a lot of the site from <a href=\"https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog\">the Eleventy example blog</a> and from a layout from <a href=\"https://teppyslayouts.neocities.org/\">teppy</a>, but I put some small finishing touches on my self. Hopefully I have the motivation to continue writing here, but even if I don't, I at least know this blog is mine.</p>\n<h2>New layout</h2>\n<p>So when I decided that I wanted to reboot this blog/personal website, I knew I wanted it to be simpler and built more from the ground up. While I orignally was going to do the whole site in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, I decided that if I were actually using the blog, it would be worth the effort to use a static site generator. Comparing Astro, Hugo, Jekkyl, and more, I eventually decided that I would write the site using Eleventy. Eleventy seemed relatively simple to use and to move to from just HTML. This made it easier for me to use an existing <a href=\"https://teppyslayouts.neocities.org/04\">layout and theme</a> that I liked.</p>\n<p>However, it has been quite a bit since I've written/programmed anything. I was almost dead off the water from the start. Luckily, Eleventy is quite popular and I was able to quickly learn just enough to start (although I didn't really learn much since most of this site is a copy of other's work).</p>\n<p>Firstly, I started by converting the layout into different Nunjucks components. While I originally grappled with not changing the CSS and HTML and sticking with seperate <code>base.njk</code> and <code>header.njk</code>, I folded and decided that since the navigation bar was simple enough, I would just put it within <code>base.njk</code>.</p>\n<p>After that, I moved the actual website content from <code>base.njk</code> to <code>index.md</code> so it would be easier for me to edit the home page of the site if I needed to. With this, I now had a somewhat working website. I still wanted to add more though.</p>\n<p>While I had an existing blog, I never used it and thought that it should have a refresh while I was already working on this site. So I decided that I should also write the blog using Eleventy. This turned out to be really easy to implement since there was an existing blog <a href=\"https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog\">template</a> provided by the Eleventy authors. This blog fit my needs really well; it was really simple, it supports code blocks through prismjs, and seemed pretty simple to implement into my existing site.</p>\n<p>I still haven't flushed out all the kinks of this setup and would like to set up a few more things. I've been trying for a while to create a simple button in the nav bar that allows changing from dark to light mode but have not been able to figure out how to do this without changing a bunch of other things. I also would like to figure out how the image templates from the example blog work so that images are better for web use. I tried to get it to work, but relative pathes kept messing me up. Finally, I would like to rewrite the parts I took from others to be my own work. It kinda feels like I'm stealing by using everyone else's work.</p>\n<p>If you're still reading this, I would like to thank you. Hopefully I'll write something else after this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OnscreenProton</li>\n</ul>\n",

Over the past few months I've found a few new pieces of software such as <a href=\"https://github.com/zadam/trilium\">trilium notes</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/usememos/memos\">memos</a> that seem pretty cool. I've also set foot into the world of federated social media with new accounts on <a href=\"https://wetdry.world/@onscreenproton\">Mastodon</a> and <a href=\"https://leathallava.land/@onscreenproton\">lavafish</a>. Both of these seem pretty interesting and I hope to stay active on both.</p>\n<p>That's pretty much it for now and I hope to have something else to put here sometime soon. I'm just thinking about what else I should put here.</p>\n",

I rebooted this for no reason other than I felt like it. I'm not really sure what I'll put here, but I guess I'll find out later. As I wrote in my intro thing for this site, I don't really know a ton about programming at all, but maybe I'll have motivation to learn more if I find a project I want to work on.</p>\n<h2>Misc</h2>\n<p>If you are going to contact me, I'm not really active on any platform other than Discord, so that would be perfered.</p>\n",
